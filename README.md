# burger

* Purpose:
The purpose of this assignment was to create an application using MVC organization process along with handlebars as a templating language to replace html.

* Organization:
The code utilizes nodejs/expressjs as the primary code.

* The MVC file organization requires 3 primary categories of files: Model, View, Control.
    * 1. Config folder -- contains the connections.js and the ORM.js.
    * 2. Control folder -- contains the burger_controller.js.
    * 3. DB folder -- contains the database schema file and the seeds file for the database.
    * 4. Models Folder -- contains the burger.js file.
    * 5. Public folder -- contains the external style sheet, images and burgers.js.
    * 6. Views folder -- contains the handlebars.
    * 7. Server.js file.
